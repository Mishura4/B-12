B-12 is a discord bot written in C++ using the library [D++](https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/DPP). Features are added as I need them from my own server, for now I have no intention of pushing features and/or to purpose the bot for general use by other servers.

Compilation requires a patch on D++ to make clang-cl compilation work : see [dep/dpp-patch.diff](dep/dpp-patch.diff). I intend to create pull requests for D++ soon, so they can fix it upstream.
