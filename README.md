B-12 is a discord bot written in C++ using the library [D++](https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/DPP). Features are added as I need them for my own server, for now I have no intention of pushing features and/or to purpose the bot for general use by other servers.

Some of the code was written in haste and as I was getting used to C++20, and as such may be crude and not make optimal use of newer features such as the ranges library.
